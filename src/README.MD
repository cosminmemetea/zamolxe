# üåç Zamolxe ‚Äî Urban Cognitive Nervous System
Core concept:
A unified City Cognitive Nervous System that:

Feels the city (sensors, citizens‚Äô devices, cameras, IoT, satellites, social media signals)

Thinks (AI/ML models, fusion reasoning, predictive analytics)

Acts (adaptive infrastructure control, alerts, automated responses, policy feedback)

Think of Zamolxe not as "an app" or "a dashboard," but as the brain stem + prefrontal cortex for an entire smart city.
Mars? Earth? Doesn't matter. Same nervous system.

## üß† System Pillars
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Perception Layer ("Zamolxe Sensus")
IoT, Computer Vision, Lidar, Air quality, Traffic cams

Citizen phone inputs, wearables, public social media

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Fusion Layer ("Zamolxe Cortex")
Data fusion models

ML-driven anomaly detection

Situation assessment (urban weather, crime prediction, congestion, health outbreaks)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Decision & Reasoning Layer ("Zamolxe Logos")
RL (Reinforcement Learning) for adaptive infrastructure (traffic, utilities)

Generative AI for recommendations & scenario simulation

City-wide KPIs optimization (energy use, air quality, citizen satisfaction)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Action Layer ("Zamolxe Motorica")
Sends commands to infrastructure: street lights, traffic systems, public messaging, building systems
